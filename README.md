### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm Daniela

A few things about me...

-I am currently relearning CSS and HTML to build my Github page. I started coding with HTMl back in 2008. Moved on to C++ and Java in college. Stopped when I changed degrees.

-I now have more experience with Illustrator and the webdesign portion of webpages as related to UX. 

-I enjoy dabbling in all types of coding for the problem solving.  

-Here to enjoy myself and to set up my personal webpage.
